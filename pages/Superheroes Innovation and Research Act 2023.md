Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA)
==============================================================

POFMAâ€™s primary tools to counter online falsehoods are the correction directions - these directions do not require the online falsehood to be removed. In more serious cases, a stop communication or disabling direction may be used.

These directions can only be issued if:

*   A false statement of fact has been or is being communicated in Singapore through the Internet; and
*   It is in the public interest to issue the direction.
