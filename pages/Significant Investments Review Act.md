<h3><strong>What is the Significant Investments Review Act?</strong></h3><p>The Significant Investments Review Act (SIRA) is an Act to protect the national security interests of Singapore by regulating significant investments in, and control of, critical entities. The Act sets out an investment management regime, which applies to both local and foreign investors, thereby providing a level playing field for all investors. SIRA complements existing sectoral legislation by regulating entities which are not adequately covered under these legislation.</p><p>Entities which have acted against Singapore’s national security interests may also have their transactions reviewed under certain circumstances, even if they have not been designated.</p><p>You may access the Significant Investments Review Act 2023 <a href="osir.gov.sg/designated/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4><strong>Designated Entities</strong></h4><p>Only entities that are critical to Singapore’s national security interests will be designated under this regime (“designated entities”) and will be regulated.
