    <label for="accordion1">What cases will the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) investigate?</label>
    <div>
      <p>The CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases of essential goods and services that use the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a cover. </p>
      <p>A number of factors could lead to price increases, such as an increase in operating costs including wages, utilities, rental and materials. </p>
			<p>If a business raises its prices, it is not acceptable for the business to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the GST implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after the GST implementation, citing the GST as the reason.</p>

			<p>You can visit any of the People's Association Community Clubs/Centres (<a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg" target="_blank">www.pa.gov.sg</a>) or call 6797 0618 (Mondays to Fridays, except Public Holidays, 9am to 6pm).</p>

    <label for="accordion5">How will the CAP follow up on the feedback raised?</label>
    <div>
			<p>The CAP works closely with partner agencies and organisations, including the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), the People’s Association (PA), and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), to assess the feedback provided on unjustified price increases of essential goods and services that use the GST increase as a cover, and engage the relevant businesses where necessary to find out reasons for the price increase. </p>
      <p>As part of the investigation process, the CAP will evaluate the explanations provided by the business for the price increase, to determine if it constitutes profiteering on the GST increase. The CAP may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer on the pretext of the rise in GST.</p>
